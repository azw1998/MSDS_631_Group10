# MSDS_631_Group10

This notebook contains the slides and Jupyter notebook from Anthony Wang and Yuefan Wang's final project in MSDS 631. 

## Objectives

Our motivation behind this project was to approach object detection from a different perspective. Often times, object detection in deep learning is to train a model that can mimic a human being's object detection ability.
